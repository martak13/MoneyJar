Fill in two required fields: 'Loan'(the amount of money you want to borrow from a bank) and 'Down payment'(The amount of money you can give to the bank instantly, so you can pay less each next month) and choose the bank.

  If something is wrong you will get one of these two messages:

    2. Bank cannot lent you money because your 'Down payment' is less than required.
